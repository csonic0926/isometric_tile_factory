## Game Studio Factory routing (managed block — edit via setup.py, not by hand)

Resolve `$STUDIO_ROOT` from `design/STUDIO_FACTORY.local.md`, falling back to
legacy `design/AI_FACTORY.local.md`. Both pointers remain supported.
Run `python3 $STUDIO_ROOT/factory.py inspect --game-repo .` first. This project
uses Factory v2 only after `design/factory/PROJECT.json` activates version 2.
`MIGRATION_REQUIRED` blocks new v2 work; never reinterpret historical approvals.

Whole-game intent uses `game-studio-factory`; deliberately bounded work uses
`idea-factory`, `gameplay-factory`, `game-story-factory`, or the Asset/Sound
landing. Current work and role context come from `factory.py context`.
The primary agent continues design and production. The exact complete design
receives two independent boundary reviews under
`$STUDIO_ROOT/factory_core/docs/WORKFLOW.md`. That adopted v2 **process** replaces
Factory-generated per-step workers, repeated generic transition reviews and
separate Card/spec authors and whole-HEAD freshness, not this project's semantic
or content requirements. For v2, these process replacements also govern earlier
Factory workflow clauses in project sync/authoring documents; all their project
quality obligations and exact pending/historical rulings remain intact.
Card views project one design. Existing authorized repairs do not reopen design.

Product adoption, material design approval and exact-build human playtest remain
USER-owned. Idea exploration may remain open or no-fit. Root/project rules,
product lifecycle, gameplay standards and story sovereignty still bind.
New gameplay acceptance still requires exact-build interaction, isolated blind
observation, informed comparison, human verdict and predecessor regression.
An interactive software demo is not an Accepted Playable Baseline.
Runtime evidence alone cannot authorize or promote gameplay.

Factory outputs belong in this game repo, never in the Factory checkout.
